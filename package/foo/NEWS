CHANGES IN foo 0.5

  • License change to CC0
    (https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode)
    following discussion on r-devel mailing list.  CRAN allows
    "Unlimited" for license field in DESCRIPTION file (which is
    what we had before), but it is legally very unclear what that.

  • Moved what was in file CHANGES (which is not a name recommended
    by _Writing R Extensions_) to this file (NEWS).

  • No changes to package, only changes to README.md for github.
